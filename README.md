# Project: Deep Learning 4 All

The goal of the project is that of creating a GPU library, hardware-agnostic in order to further democratize Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence allowing for ***anyone*** to leverage whatever parallel compute
they possess, be it an integrated GPU in a CPU, or an older AMD GPU that is not included in the ROCm family.

Then this library will also wrap up with the PyTorch (and perhaps TensorFlow some day) Python libraries in order to fully leverage the power of *parallel computation* with ***no additional cost** and ***without vendor locking***

## Main Roadmap 

üõ†Ô∏è What you could do next (if serious)

Here‚Äôs how you might start:

üîπ Phase 1: Proof of Concept
	‚Ä¢	Implement a Tensor class in C++ that wraps OpenCL buffers
	‚Ä¢	Build a simple add, matmul, conv2d kernel
	‚Ä¢	Create a PyTorch C++ Extension that routes a few ops to your OpenCL backend

üîπ Phase 2: Add device/runtime manager
	‚Ä¢	Implement device registration, memory allocator, simple scheduler
	‚Ä¢	Support both CPU + GPU compute fallbacks
	‚Ä¢	Explore OpenCL peer-to-peer support or zero-copy

üîπ Phase 3: Distributed runtime
	‚Ä¢	Design message passing over network (gRPC or MPI)
	‚Ä¢	Split model and gradients
	‚Ä¢	Implement async parameter sync (ala DDP, Horovod)
